also be of use to designers in other situations where development teams are
distributed.<p>
<a name="fn1">[2]</a>To facilitate understanding of paper copies of this
document, the appendix describes summarizes  the patterns from [Coplien95]
[Gamma+94] and [Beck] referenced in this paper.<p>
<a name="fn2">[3]</a>This particular structure is based on that of the X-ray
Timing Explorer project (XTE), currently in progress at the MIT Center for
Space Research. <p>
<a name="fn3">[4]</a>It can be argued that minimizing coupling is an important
consideration in building any system, but because of the degree of
decentralization and non locality in the projects being discussed here, it is
especially important.<p>
<sup>5</sup><i>Query Objects</i> addresses the problem of handling the
generation and executation of SQL statements in an object-oriented way, when
you are trying to use a relational database to store objects.<p>
<sup>6</sup>This pattern is not yet written, but would specify a mechanism for
notifying a base class factory that a derived class factory has been created.
The basic idea would be similar to the View/Model connection in a
Model/View/Controller mechanism, but would also address issues of uniqueness
(only one instance of each derived class can notify a base class) and
guaranteed notification (the construction of any object/factory of the derived
classes would generate a registration event automatically).<p>
