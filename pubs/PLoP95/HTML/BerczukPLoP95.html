<blockquote>Organizational issues play a significant role in many software
architectures, though often more as a side effect than by design. This paper
presents a pattern language for developing ground software for satellite
telemetry systems that illustrates how to take organization into account in the
architecture. In particular, this paper addresses:
<ul>
<li>extending a pattern from the 1995 PLoP conference [Berczuk95] into a pattern
language.
<li>assembling patterns from other pattern languages into a domain specific
pattern language,  and
<li>	including social context as a motivating context for a pattern.
</ul>
Since scientific research satellite systems are often developed at academic
institutions, where similarities between ongoing projects exist only at the
architectural level (code typically cannot be reused), documenting
architectural insights such as these in the pattern form can be a very
practical way to achieve reuse. Since assembly of telemetry involves
(re)creation of objects from a serial stream, these patterns are relevant to
designers of any systems which creates objects from a serial stream
</blockquote><h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">Introduction</a></h2>
Organizational issues have an impact on the development of software systems. It
is important to design an architecture in a way that fits well with existing
social and organizational constraints.<p>
As an example of how these issues can be addressed, this paper presents a
pattern language to guide the development of a ground based system that will<i>
</i>process telemetry data from an earth-orbiting astronomical observatory.
Systems of this type involve many diverse, and often geographically distributed
groups of people;  such a system is challenging to design from a social as well
as a technical point of view.<a href="BerczukPLoP95_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a>  The
patterns present in this system are applicable to other systems that have
similar organizational constraints. Since telemetry can be considered a form of
persistence, where objects are serialized into a stream and transmitted, some
of these patterns will also be of interest to builders of systems that use
parsing and reconstruction of objects from a serial data stream.<p>
This pattern language makes use of Coplien's patterns of organization
[Coplien95]<a href="BerczukPLoP95_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a> as context for the other
patterns, and also shows how to effect some of these patterns in the context of
a ground based scientific telemetry processing system. <p>
After a description of the relevant elements of the organizatonal structure of
a typical project, patterns which address some of the issues raised by this
structure will be described.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Project
Organization
</a></h2>
Most of the projects being pursued at the Center For Space Research at MIT
share an organization similar to the following:<a
href="BerczukPLoP95_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a><p>
<IMG SRC="BerczukPLoP951.gif"><p>
<b>Typical Project Organization</b>
<ul>
<li>	A number of <i>instrument teams</i> each with primary responsibility for
deployment and analysis of the data from a single scientific instrument that
will be on the satellite. Often these teams will be at geographically separate
locations. 
<li>	A central organization (the <i>operations center</i>) which performs a
coordination function. The operations center may not have the expertise to
understand the scientific objectives of each of the instrument teams, and is
focused on the operational aspects of the system (processing so many bytes of
telemetry per second, and archiving data, for example).
<li>	A small base of shared knowledge between instrument teams and operations
center.
<li>	Small work groups, particularly at the instrument team locations. At each
team site, many of the subsystems fulfill the context of <i>Solo Virtuoso
</i>[Coplien95].</ul>The architecture of the data analysis system takes the
following general form:<p>
<IMG SRC="BerczukPLoP952.gif"><p>
<b>Typical Architecture</b><p>
<b></b>The operations center depends on the instrument teams for providing
details about telemetry specific to each instrument.<p>
Each of the teams has very different motivations; the instrument teams are
focused on getting the best science from "their" instruments, and the
operations team is focused on getting the system assembled (with science often
a secondary consideration). The teams have a large degree of autonomy, but they
must agree on certain interfaces. As a result, a minimal amount of coupling is
best<a href="BerczukPLoP95_fn.html#fn3">[4]</a>. A major challenge in designing
an architecture of such a system is to handle the organizational and political
issues that arise, in such a way that individual organizations are not overly
affected by external forces. <p>
The general organizational forces involved in scientific satellite telemetry
processing systems can be summarized as follows: 
<ul>
<li>	Distributed experience
<li>	Small teams, distributed geographically.
<li>	Little carryover of personnel from one project to the next.</ul>This paper
focuses on the process of classification and interpretation of the telemetry
packets as they are received from the spacecraft, and dispatching the resulting
data objects for further processing. Other patterns can be written to guide the
development of other aspects of the system such as commanding and data
analysis.<p>
While this paper discusses patterns found in a scientific satellite
application, the patterns have applications to other domains as well.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">The
Patterns
</a></h2>
The architectural goals and the patterns that complete them are as follows:<p>
*	Facilitate autonomous development: <i>Loose Interfaces</i><p>
*	Interpret a Data Stream: <i>Parser/Builder</i><p>
*	Divide responsibilities for interpretation: <i>Hierarchy of Factories</i><p>
*	Connect Systems: <i>Handlers</i>
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">1.
	Loose Interfaces
</a></h2>
<i>Context</i>:<i> </i>To help development of a system with many teams
proceeding at a reasonable pace it is important  to keep interfaces between
systems loose. This is particularly important in a situation where there are
teams of developers that are geographically distributed and a situation where
rapid turnaround time for design and development is important. <p>
<i>Problem</i>: Communication is difficult. If requirements are changing and
the teams are located in a variety of places then the poor communication can
stall a project. This can be particularly problematic when an organization does
not have an architectural center, such as specified by <i>Architect Controls
Product </i>[Coplien95].<p>
This is particularly applicable in a research satellite application where teams
are small, requirements are changing, and the potential for gridlock is great
if dependencies are too high. The operations center is the organizational
center of the architecture, but does not always have the capability to design a
complete system. To avoid development bottlenecks, we need to be able to limit
the effect one team's work will have on another.<p>
<i>Therefore</i>: Limit the number of explicit, static, interfaces. Use loose
interfaces like <i>Callback</i> and <i>Parser/Builder</i> and <i>Hierarchy of
Factories</i> to achieve this.<p>
Decoupling interfaces in this way will also simplify the development of
<i>Early Program</i> [Beck], since it provides a mechanism for building
incremental systems. It can also facilitate implementation of <i>Developer
Controls Process </i>[Coplien95], by making it easy to define features that can
be controlled by a developer or group.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">2.
Parser/Builder
</a></h2>
<i>Context</i>: Many systems need to read data from a stream and classify
elements on the steam as objects. A way is needed to create arbitrary objects
based on tokens in the data stream. <p>
<i>Problem</i>:  Given a data stream, we want to interpret it, classifying the
elements into the appropriate class of object. The data stream contains tags
that can be used to identify the raw data, and we want to convert the stream
into object form, so we can process the data. <p>
As a non-telemetry related example consider the problem of reading in raw UNIX
files and classifying them into types of files based on their "magic number"
--as in the tags in the /etc/magic file. You could create the appropriate
subclass of <i>File</i> and then invoke its virtual edit() method,  bringing up
the appropriate editor. <p>
In a telemetry processing system each telemetry packet has identifying
information in its header. The telemetry processing system design requires that
an object, once created, knows how to process itself (i.e., we will not use a
dispatch table, or a switch on type-- this is to satisfy the <i>Organization
Follows Location</i>[Coplien95] pattern). At the lowest level objects will be
created using a <i>Factory Method</i> [Gamma+94]. Each class of packets will be
processed differently; some will assemble themselves into larger units, others
will issue messages.  Consider the following hierarchy, as shown in figure 1,
for a spacecraft that there are two subclasses of <i>Packet</i>:<i>APackets</i>
and <i>BPackets</i>.<p>
<IMG SRC="BerczukPLoP953.gif"><p>
<b>Sample Packet Hierarchy</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>We want each <i>Packet</i>, once created, to process itself by using a
virtual method, <i>process()</i>. If we pass  a data stream into a factory, we
want  to return  a pointer to a <i>Packet</i> that has the appropriate type.
To summarize the forces:
<ul>
<li>	There is a need to interpret a raw data stream.
<li>	There is a generic way to process the packets once they are returned from
the factory. 
<li>	The raw data contain tags which can be used for
classification.</ul><i>Therefore: </i>to resolve these forces use a
<i>Parser/Builder</i> which reads the identifying information from the header
of the packet, and creates an object of the appropriate type, removing only one
object's worth of data from the stream. <p>
An example of a client interface is:

<pre>
	while (!dataStream.empty()) {
		PacketFactory f;
		Packet* p = f.make(dataStream);
		if(p) p-&gt;process()
	}
</pre>
This
is a variant of <i>Abstract Factory</i>[Gamma+94] but the object to be created
is defined in the data stream, rather than by the client. <i>Factories</i> and
<i>Parser/Builder</i>s can be used to in part implement <i>Loose Interfaces
</i> by providing a means of separating clients from producers of data
(assuming that data producers also define the factories). 
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC7">Other
uses:
</a></h2>
In some object persistence mechanisms, objects are assigned class Id's which
are placed in the storage stream. These Ids are restored first to allow the
system decide what class object to make from the restored stream. <p>
<i>Parser/Builder</i> is used in in the pattern <i>Query Objects</i>
<sup>5</sup>[Chasms] to convert SQL statements to QUERY objects. [Riehle96]
discusses similar issues, building objects on a desktop using specifications.<p>
The distinction between this pattern and <i>Builder</i> [Gamma+94] and
<i>Factory Method</i> [Gamma+94] is that in this pattern the factory reads from
a stream and the client does not know which type of object will be returned.
For text interpretation, <i>Parser/Builder</i> can be a front end to the
<i>Interpreter</i> [Gamma+94] pattern.  
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">3.
Hierarchy of Factories 
</a></h2>
<u>Also Known As:</u> <i>Composite Factory</i><b></b><p>
<b></b><i>Context</i>: Once we decide that the <i>Parser/Builder</i> is the
right way to create objects, we need to partition the details of how to
construct objects of various classes into the various groups responsible for
this construction, in other words we need to have <i>Loose Interfaces</i>. We
want to complete <i>Form Follows Function</i> [Coplien95] or <i>Organization
Follows Location</i> [Coplien95].  On a lower level we want to implement
<i>Developer Controls Process </i>[Coplien95] for a system which creates
objects of various types.<p>
<i>Problem</i>: In a distributed work group it is important to divide
responsibilities as cleanly as possible and reduce coupling. There should be a
way to do this in a creational system.<p>
Sometimes the secrets of classifying elements in a data stream are divided
between various groups. The reasons for this partitioning can involve company
politics, or simply that the knowledge of the telemetry formats is distributed
and there is a strong desire to reduce coupling.  We need a way to partition
the responsibilities for classifying the telemetry packets, while maintaining a
centralized client interface.  <p>
In a telemetry application, various instruments can generate telemetry which is
then fed into one stream. The instruments are  developed by different teams (at
different institutions, for example),  and these teams have control over the
format of the telemetry that they generate (after taking some standard headers
into account).<p>
We want a way to isolate the details for identifying each team's objects, while
at the same time allowing the objects to be identified and created in a single
application. The scheme that we develop should be layered so that the main
factory needs to know only of the existence of a class of objects, but need not
know how deep the hierarchy below that class is. Packets created from the
hierarchy are processed in a generic way,  perhaps by using virtual functions.
<p>
One way to address the classification problem is to put all the
classification/dispatch logic into a single <i>Parser/Builder</i> (combining
the <i>Interpreter</i> [Gamma+94] pattern with a <i>Builder </i>[Gamma+94]) --
perhaps by using a big switch statement-- and rely on communications between
groups to ensure that the details make it into the master code through some
communications method. This is error prone, and subject to delays. We could
also divide the processing into a number of factories and have the client call
each in turn. This violates our requirement of  transparency, and the client
needs to know when a new class of object is  added.<p>
It would be useful to have a way to have the client interface emulate a single
Factory, but hide the details of the construction hierarchy. <p>
To summarize the forces:
<ul>
<li>	Division of responsibilities (<i>Organization Follows Location</i>).
<li>	A need for a central interface for parsing data streams and building
objects.
<li>	A need to add objects to the construction hierarchy in a manner
transparent to clients.
<li>	The ability (or requirement) to process entities by virtual functions. 
<li>	Each class of object can know about its immediate derived
classes.</ul><i>Therefore</i>: Use a hierarchy of factories, each of which
understands the criteria  for making a packet of its type, and knows about the
immediate  subtypes. The client invokes the make method with the base class
factory instance. That factory checks to see that there is indeed an object of
class packet in the stream, based on some attributes. The factory then passes
the data stream to the factories of each of its immediate  subclasses, which
check the appropriate data fields in the manner of  the <i>Parser/Builder</i>
pattern.<p>
 The <i>Singleton</i> pattern [Gamma+94] can be used to access the factories
for the derived classes, or the members of the hierarchy can be registered with
the master factory at run time.<p>
 While this pattern violates encapsulation to some extent by requiring that a
base class know about its immediate subclasses, it can be made acceptable by
agreeing on generic interface classes (say, one per team) and allow each team
free reign to subclass these interface classes. Also in this application this
requirement is not terribly limiting, since the top level operations team knows
abou the basic instrument team interfaces and the number of instrument teams is
fixed by contract when the project begins.<p>
 
<IMG SRC="BerczukPLoP954.gif"><p>
<b>Hierarchy of Factories</b><p>
<b></b>An example implementation is:

<pre>
//Base class factory method
	Packet* PacketFactory::make(Stream* dataStream){
	 Packet* pkt=0;
	if(isAPacket(dataStream) {
 	if(! pkt = APacket::factory()-&gt;make(dataStream))
	  if(!pkt = BPacket::factory()-&gt;make(dataStream)){	
	  pkt = new Packet(dataStream);	
	}
	return pkt;
	}
</pre>

The result of applying  this pattern is that each class needs to know only:
<ul>
<li>	The criteria for what constitutes a member of that class in terms of
elements in the data stream.
<li>	The immediate subclasses.</ul>It is possible to use a <i>Registration</i>
<sup>6</sup> mechanism to inform the base class of what the subclasses are
rather than hard coding the relationship. It is also possible to implement this
pattern using containment rather than inheritance.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC9">Other
uses:
</a></h2>
This pattern is also useful for isolating the definition of packets for which a
single team is responsible, so the information can be encapsulated, making it
easier to work on a project with large or widely distributed teams.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">Related
Patterns
</a></h2>
This is similar to the <i>Builder</i> [Gamma+94] pattern in that it has a
hierarchy of "factories." It is different in that the data stream defines what
is made rather than the application explicitly specifying what objects to
construct by argumenst to the factory.<p>
This pattern helps us realize <i>Organization Follows Location</i> and <i>Code
Ownership</i> [Coplien95]
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">4.
Handlers <a href="BerczukPLoP95_fn.html#fn4">[7]</a>
</a></h2>
 <i>Context</i>: This pattern provides for decoupling needed to implement
<i>Organization Follows Location</i> [Coplien95], for the products of a
creational system. After we assemble packets from the telemetry stream we
process them, generating data products. We need a way to direct the processing
of these new data products. <p>
<i>Problem</i>: In an environment where components developed by separate teams
with different specific goals must inter-operate, it is necessary to partition
responsibilities in such a way that dependencies can be reduced while
interoperability is maintained. In particular well defined portions of the
system should be isolated fron the to be specified pieces. This may be
particularly important if the teams are geographically distributed.<p>
To summarize the forces at work:<p>
*	The requirements for the end to end system are not complely specified.<p>
*	Requirements for one component of a system need to be available before
downstream processing is defined.<p>
*	Upstream and downstream components will be demonstrated/tested at different
times.<p>
*	Upstream components should know nothing of the downstream processing.<p>
<p>
 
<IMG SRC="BerczukPLoP955.gif"><p>
<b>Callback Pattern</b><p>
<b></b><i>Solution</i>: Use a callback mechanism to define connections between
assembly process and the processing process. Provide a mechanism
(<i>Registration</i>) to assign a <i>Handler</i> object for which a completed
entity will be forwarded.<p>
One implementation uses a static <i>Handler</i> data member for class
<i>Unit</i>. Whenever a <i>Unit</i> is completed it hands itself to the
<i>Handler</i> for processing. <p>
The issue of when to subclass and when to differentiate objects by an attribute
can be a confusing one, and can only be resolved by examing the specific
details such as the number of classes, and the type of behaviour. <p>
This pattern is similar to <i>Observer</i> [Gamma+94] but differs in that the
"observer" is the class of object being created, and the event that triggers
the notification is the creation of an object of a class.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Conclusions</a></h2>
Organizational issues play a significant role in determining the direction a
software system can take. They affect the context in which a system is
developed. It is also necessary to architect a system to minimize the negative
effects of organizational issues. When the  organizational patterns such as
those in [Coplien95] exist, there should be ways to architect a system to aid
the realization of good organizational patterns. This paper illustrates some of
the ways to reflect organizational issues in the context of other patterns as
well as showing some ways to implement good organizational patterns in a
software architecture.<p>
There is a common structure to scientific satellite applications, and there
also tends to be little carryover of personnel between projects, so many of the
lessons learned must be rediscovered. Since there are different hardware and
software platforms from one project to the next and the details of each project
vary greatly, <i>code reuse</i> is not really feasible. <i>Design elements</i>
can be reused, however. This application domain, and others which share these
factors, could benefit greatly from documentation of architectural principles
as patterns. <p>
While the patterns explicitly address scientific spacecraft satellite
telemetry, the ideas in this paper can be applicable to any system being built
with a number of distinct teams. Some of the patterns such as
<i>Parser/Builder</i> also have applicability in other creational systems.
