 Alexander Explains the motivation behind a pattern language and
provides an example of a well developed one [1][2]. Lea provides
historical perspective on patterns languages, as well as a description
of how they relate to architecture. Coad gives guidelines for finding
patterns for object-oriented analysis and design. Gabriel discusses
how we can use patterns to begin understanding what quality is in
software.[5]
<P>
Current applications of patterns include Coplien's book on C++ idioms [6]
and the forthcoming design patterns by gammaa et al.[7]. Siemens is
cataloging patterns for possible reuse in architectures.[8]
