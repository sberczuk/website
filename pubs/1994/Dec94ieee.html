Interest in patterns and pattern languages has been on the
upswing, fueled by the realization among software developers that
they must simplify the process of building increasingly large and
complex systems. Patterns are forms for describing architectural
constructs in a manner that emphasizes these constructs' potential
for reuse. They provide a way to document and share design
expertise in an application-independent fashion. As evidence of
this growing interest, early in August more than 70 software
practitioners gathered to discuss patterns and pattern languages
at the first annual conference on Pattern Languages of Programs.

<p>
The idea of using patterns and pattern languages is borrowed from
work done in building architecture to describe qualities for good
architectural designs. In the seventies, the architect Christopher
Alexander started using pattern languages to describe the events
and forms that appeared in cities, towns, and buildings in the
world at large. Alexander's pattern language is "a system which
allows its users to create an infinite variety of those . . .
combinations of patterns which we call buildings, gardens, and
towns." [1] Alexander defines a pattern as "a rule which describes
what you have to do to generate the entity which it defines." [1]
A pattern describes a solution to a problem in an environment "in
such a way that you can use this solution a million times over,
without ever doing it the same way twice." [2] Alexander documents
patterns that exist all around us; for example, each building is
unique, yet all buildings share many features.

<p>
One of Alexander's patterns is called "Master and Apprentices." It
describes how to arrange workspaces so that new employees can
learn by being in proximity to their mentors and use day-to-day
experiences as a training mechanism. Although the advantages of
having trainees learn from the daily work environment may seem
obvious, in many organizations the office setup does not encourage
this. Documenting this pattern, and referring to it when designing
offices, helps a less experienced architect build a quality
workplace.

<p>
Software development presents an analogous situation.
Independently developed software systems often share common
elements of an architectural structure. An example of a low-level
pattern in C++ is checking for a nonnull pointer after allocating
an object with new (this could also be called an "idiom" [3]).
Most programs do this, and ones that don't are likely to run into
problems. An example of a higher level pattern is the use of
callbacks to initiate an operation when an event happens. Higher
still are patterns of structure in software development
organizations. [4] These patterns are discovered by experience. By
documenting these patterns and their relationships, we can develop
a set of languages to guide developers in building new systems.

<p>
The connection between Alexander's patterns and software
architecture has led many in the software community to argue for a
higher-level organizing principle in software than that of
objects. Much recent discussion logically centers on objectoriented 
design, where it is natural to discuss interactions
between entities. Yet patterns have uses in other paradigms, and
people are beginning to propose patterns that apply to shell
scripts and other procedural systems.

<p>
An Alexandrian pattern consists of the following components: [2]

<UL>
  <LI> A name, which describes briefly what the pattern
     accomplishes within certain larger patterns.

  <LI> A concise problem statement.

  <LI> The body of the problem, including the motivation for the
     pattern and the forces involved in resolving the problem.

  <LI> A solution, preferably stated in the form of an instruction.

  <LI> A discussion of how the pattern relates to other patterns in
     the language.

</UL>
<p>
We can create a similar form using patterns to document software
frameworks [5] and architectures. A pattern language is a set of
patterns that guide an architect through a design. Each pattern is
a description of a solution to a problem using other patterns that
occur in the system. The details of the form vary, but the
essential elements are context, problem, and solution.

<p>
Figure 1 contains a simple example of a pattern. Notice that the
callback mechanism described here is similar to the callback
mechanism used by window managers to connect events to user
events. This illustrates the power of patterns. They describe the
static and dynamic structures that occur in a variety of software
systems in a manner that emphasizes common aspects that make the
pattern applicable across domains. (The Proceedings of the First
Conference on Pattern Languages [6] contains more involved
examples of patterns.)

<p>
Alexander's pattern language contains over 250 patterns, organized
from high level to low level. The goal in documenting patterns
that exist in software architectures is to arrive at a similar
system, but this will take time. When we begin to document
patterns, smaller and larger ones will be discovered, so the
context cannot always immediately be specified entirely in terms
of existing patterns. But we can ultimately specify context by
discussing the situation that surrounds the problem.

<p>
Pattern languages are a useful medium for documenting software
architectures. Unlike other ways of describing the design, a
pattern by definition describes the motivation surrounding the
decision to use a particular solution, including the context and
forces influencing the design. Patterns are often independent of
the implementation language and can be used to describe
connections between components.

<p>
Why use patterns? The pattern form is well suited to documenting
design techniques. Unlike a design document, a pattern reflects
something that has been used in a number of situations and thus
has some generality. It has a context, which explains the intent
of the pattern and suggests how it is to be used. Patterns also
express solutions in ways that allow for some variation depending
on the details of a circumstance. Finally, patterns can express
architectural considerations independent of language and design
methodology.

<p>
A designer wishing to use patterns can take a number of
approaches. One is to compile patterns from a domain into a book
and hand it to system architects. Another is to develop a system
to catalog these patterns and use a tool to extract a pattern
appropriate to the problem at hand. While a system of patterns (a
language) is the ultimate goal, there are many stand-alone
patterns that can and should be documented.

<p>
Although patterns are often discovered during design, and using a
pattern language will aid design, writing patterns is not part of
a design methodology. Patterns are discovered from experience.
Writing the patterns found in an application helps future
developers of similar applications integrate the key architectural
components.

<p>
Patterns exist in our software. When they are documented, design
wisdom can be leveraged by other projects in your company.
