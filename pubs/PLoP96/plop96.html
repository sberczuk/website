Configuration management is part of an efficient development process.
As with other aspects of software development, configuration management
happens in the presence of social and organizational constraints.
The various goals of configuration management (stability, developer
independence and interaction, etc.) sometimes conflict with each
other. This paper presents three configuration management patterns
and shows how the forces between them balance out. It also relates
them to organizational patterns.
<H1>Introduction</H1>

<P>
Software configuration management (SCM) is an important aspect
of development process. A good SCM process makes it possible for
teams of developers to work together on a project  effectively.
While there are various tools that can make the process simpler,
there are certain patterns  for software configuration management
that exist unsuccessful development organizations. 
<P>
A successful configuration management process allows:
<UL>
<LI> Developers to work together on a project, sharing common
code.
<LI> Developers to share development effort on a module.

<LI> Developers to have access to the current stable (tested)
version of a system.
<LI> The ability to back up to a previous stable version (one
of a number of <I>Named Stable Bases </I>[5] ), of a <I>system</I>
<LI> The ability of a developer to checkpoint changes to a module
and to back off  to a previous version of that <I>module</I>.
</UL>
<P>
Attaining all of these goals involves compromises (many people
working of one body of code makes maintaining consistency difficult,
for example).  This paper presents 3 patterns that illustrate
how the problems presented by configuration management problems
can conflict with each other, and how the various forces can be
balanced.  We also show how SCM interacts with some of the organizational
process patterns described by Coplien [5]  and the Development
Episodes Patterns of Cunningham[6] .
<P>
The goals of this paper are to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Illustrate how patterns can be applied to the mechanics
of software development. 
<LI> Show how configuration management and organizational patterns
interact.

<LI> Provide an illustration of how the forces in some patterns
interact, and how one can try to balance conflicting forces.
</UL>
<P>The patterns are illustrated with an example which has the following
participants:
<UL>
<LI> A number of Developer Workspaces, each representing the
environment of  a specific developer in the organization. 
<LI> The Project Repository, which is the common set of files
which are used in a development project, for example, the Version
Control system.
</UL>
Configuration management is best implemented with tools that simplify
and/or enforce policies, so reference is made to tools in the
examples. The patterns are (hopefully) independent of the tools
used.
<H1>A Guide to the Patterns</H1>

<P>
This section summarizes  the intents of the patterns.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <I>Private Versioning</I>: Allow a developer to checkpoint
changes for convience and security without violating organizational
standards regarding granularity of revisions.

<LI> <I>Incremental Integration</I>: Provide a means for a developer
to &igrave;pre-test&icirc; interfaces before an integration build.
<LI> <I>Independent Develpment</I>: Make sure that new builds
do not interfere with a developer&iacute;s work in progress.
<H1>Private Versioning</H1>
</UL>
<P>
A developer should have a way to checkpoint changes without making
these changes available to the development team at large. We want
to implement <I>Code Ownership</I>(17) [5]  but subsystems never
work entirely in isolation. 
<P>
<B>Periodic integration of a developer's work with that of other
members of the development team is important for ensuring stability.
</B>Checkpointing only after completing major changes can make
it difficult to back off of one phase of a change. Using the revision
control area for this can lead to changes being &quot;published&quot;
before they are ready for integration.  Also, publishing intermediate
changes can lead to a deceptive number of revisions listed in
the SCM system. It is necessary to be able to save intermediate
steps in a change in case a coding step results in an error. This
is particularly important when:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The mechanism for specifying that a version is ready for
integration is primitive, and another developer has access to
a version as soon as it is checked it.

<LI> There is a desire to keep the revision history database
&quot;uncluttered&quot; with only significant changes logged.
</UL>
<P>
therefore:
<P>
<I>Developers should be provided with a mechanism for check pointing
changes at a granularity that they are comfortable with. This
can be provided for by a local revision control area, Only stable
code sets are checked into the Project Repository</I>
<P>
Add a Private Repository to the Developer&iacute;s Workspace so
that a developer can save intermediate versions before checking
them in to the Repository. The Private Repository can use the
same mechanisms as the Project Repository (ie, RCS) or can simply
be a means of maintaining copies of intermediate files.
<P>
It is important to make sure that developers using <I>Private
Versioning</I> remember to migrate changes to the shared version
control system at reasonable intervals.
<P>
The revision control mechanism could also provide a means for
restricting access to checked-in versions that are not yet ready
for use by others, and could also provide a mechanism for filtering
log messages to eliminate trivial changes.
<H2>Example</H2>

<P>
The project repository using CVS for version control. Add to the
Developer workspace a shadow directory in which there is an RCS
directory for the developer&iacute;s use only. The developer copies
files to the &igrave;main&icirc; development area before checking
them into the project repository.
<H1>Incremental Integration</H1>

<P>
Some organizations have infrequent integrations which reflect
large changes. This can make it difficult for the integration
release to work as expected, complicate the process of <I>Work
Integration</I>[6]  and make <I>Named Stable Bases</I>. [5]  difficult
to achieve when modules do not work together. Because we often
develop with one Owner Per Deliverable[1]  there will be occasional
mismatches between units.
<P>
<B>For iterative development to work well, it is necessary to
make sure that components work together. </B>Subsystems get developed
at different rates. Developers work with <I>Independent Development</I>.
We need to find a way to make it possible to integrate without
surprises.
<P>
therefore:
<P>
<I>Provide a mechanism to allow developers to build all the current
software periodically. Developers should be discouraged from maintaining
long intervals between &quot;check-ins.&quot;  Developers should
also be able to build against any of the </I>Named Stable Bases,<I>
or the newest checked in software, at will.</I>
<P>
Assign the task of building the entire software system periodically.
<I>Named Stable Bases</I> suggests intervals no more frequent
that a week. This periodic build should be checked for interface
compatibility (does it compile?) and testing (Does it still work?)
Encourage developers to build from files that are likely to be
in the release (perhaps the newest code in the revision control
system&iacute;s trunk) to anticpate, and allow time to correct
for, incompatibilities. The goal is to avoid a &igrave;Big-Bang&icirc;
integration and allow the Developmental Build[6]  to proceed smoothly.
<P>
This can be combined with <I>Independent Development</I> to ensure
that the changes integrate with a copy of the current development
system. There are issues relating to the size of the software
system (some systems take quite a while to build, making frequent
integrations difficult). Balance this with <I>Private Versions</I>
to allow the developer some leeway on deciding when to integrate
their new code into their environment, but do not put it off for
too  long. 
<H2>Example</H2>

<P>
The Developer&iacute;s Workspace could be updated (at the developer&iacute;s
request) to a named stable base from the Project Repository approximately
weekly. The developer will also retrieve the current files from
the repository to anticipate how the current changes in the Workspace
will work with files that may later be in the baseline. 
<H1>Independent Development</H1>

<P>
It has been decided to implement <I>Named Stable Bases</I> (31) [5] 
However, we must balance the need to keep up to date by <I>Incremental
Integration</I>, with the desire of developers to maintain a stable
environment for feature development/bug fixing, enabling a <I>Programming
Episode</I> [6] to proceed smoothly.
<P>
<B>How can we balance the need for developers to use current revisions,
based on periodic baselines, with the desire to avoid undue grief
by having development dependencies change from underneath them?</B>
<P>
It is important for developers to work with current versions of
software subsystems to keep up with the latest enhancements, avoid
running into already fixed bugs fixed elsewhere, and to avoid
getting out of synch with interface changes.  A developer who
keeps changes un-released (or not checked in to the version control
system) can disruptother team members. <I>Named Stable Bases</I>
recommends integrations at an interval of no more than once a
week. Introducing new software into an environment while debugging
may cause grief by introducing new behavior, and providing distractions
because of the time spent resolving integration issues &oacute;
in some cases, code may no longer compile due to interface changes.
<P>
Some organizations, to facilitate <I>Incremental  Integration</I>,
will have a shared baseline of code, libraries, etc. Unfortunately
changing a code base, even in a different subsystem, can cause
problems when there are interface changes, for example. You want
to avoid hearing stories about developers leaving a problem at
night to view it in the morning with a clear head, only to find
that one's test environment does not compile.
<P>
therefore:
<P>
<I>Provide a mechanism where developers can maintain independent
development environments, This allows them to avoid having an
integration step interrupt work in progress. The environment should
represent a snapshot of all the software being developed in a
system, not just the code the developer is modifying. Try to ensure
that the private development area is not used as a means of avoiding
integration issues.</I>
<P>
This pattern conflicts somewhat with <I>Incremental Integration
</I> when a developer delays retrieving  the current release for
too long, so make sure that developers are encouraged to use integrate
their code frequently, perhaps by providing a mechanism for easily
backing of a difficult change.
<P>
A consequence of this pattern is that, depending on how this is
implemented, the disk space requirements of a project may grow
quickly as N developers will have their own copies of the source
code. But often the costs of personnel greatly exceed the cost
of an extra disk. A modification to this approach is that stable,
and distantly related subsystems can be used by reference, but
one should be made aware of when changes are imminent. In this
case the CM system should provide access to prior <I>Named Stable
Bases </I>as well. 
<P>
A variation on this pattern is to allow developers simply to defer
advancing to a new <I>Named Stable Base</I> until the current
problem is solved.
<H2>Example</H2>

<P>
A developer is working on a problem The Developer Workspace is
self contained with all of the files needed to build the system.
The Developer workspace gets updated only at the developer&iacute;s
request, after the problem is solved in the context of the current
Names Stable Base.

<P>
Software configuration management occurs at all development organizations,
with varying degrees of success, and these patterns were improved
by input from people with different experiences. Javier Barreiro
and Neil Harrison for provided me with other perspectives on configuration
management. Royce Buehler and Doug Alan worked with me on many
of the issues for the configuration management system at the MIT
Center for Space Research, on which some of these patterns are
based. David Ting first brought SCM issues (particularly those
involving remote teams) to my attention while I was at the Kodak
Boston Technology Center.  My PLoP shepherds, Russ Corfman and
DeLoy Bitner and the members of my PLoP 96 working group made
many suggestions which improved this paper.
<P>
The development of the SCM system at MIT, which inspired these
patterns, was supported in part by NASA/GSFC contract NAS5-30612.
