<h1>About This Site</h1>

<p>
This site started out around late 1993 or early 1994 when I worked at MIT, primarially
as a way to learn about web site design and HTML. It grew over time, and
every once in a while I take a look at it and move things around. Now
it is a mix of personal stuff, as well as a place to put writings that
I have published. I added the books page when I realized that I kept
recommending the same books to people.</p>

<p>I try to keep the site simple with few pictures (except on pages
that are mostly for photos). This is partly to make it easy to maintain, and
partly to make it more likely that the page will work with any web browser. My
<a href="./bookstore/">suggested books page</a> has some of my
favorite books on web design.</a> I use <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">Cascading Style Sheets</a> for
presentation effects, but the pages should still be viewable if your
browser does not support CSS. I also use Apache Server Side Includes.</p>

<p>Some technical details:
<ul>
<li>The site is hosted at <a href="http://www.pair.com"/>Pair Networks</a></li>
<li>Tools I use to work on the site:
<ul>
  <li>mostly text editors, like <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html">
emacs</a></li>
  <li>some photo editing tools.</li>
  <li>Open source FTP tools like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla">Filezilla</a> to update the site.</li>
</ul>
