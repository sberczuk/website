<h2>About SCM Patterns in Practice</h2>
<p><blockquote class="q">I use the software configuration management patterns book extensively when
consulting at a client site. The SCM patterns help me explain how good
software configuration management practices are essential to an effective
agile software development process.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="q">
Very well done.  Should be 
required reading for anyone making scm related decisions.  The patterns are 
all completely correct, and described concisely, with numerous <em>actually 
descriptive</em> illustrations.

I only wish I'd read it 8 years ago. Well done.

<h2>About the Book</h2>
<p><b>Here is what some people are saying about the book <em>Software
Configuration Management Patterns: Practical Teamwork, Effective Integration</em>:</b></p>
<hr/>
<p>
<blockquote class="q">
As a coach and trainer of agile software development teams, I am often asked by these teams how they handle the software configuration management with such fast-moving processes. These excellent and highly readable book has collected a wonderful set of practices and will become a part of the standard canon I recommend to clients.

<p>
<blockquote class="q">
Overall, Berczuk and Appleton's Software
Configuration Management Patterns
is probably the most timely, hands on,
useful book on this topic today.
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Philipp K. Janert in his review in the
<a href="/book/reviews/IEEESoftware200401.pdf">January/Feburary 2004 issue of IEEE
	Software</a>.</p>
<hr/>

<p><blockquote class="q">I think the authors have just created the new
&quot;SCM Bible&quot; that will be the new standard and reference manual to
SCM-ers and software development professionals for years and years to
come!!</blockquote>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Jeffrey W. Faist, Jeff Faist Consulting Inc.</p><br/><hr/>


<p><blockquote class="q">I'm very glad that people are still writing about SCM. For awhile, it seemed that the momentum had shifted away from competence in SCM, and the book writing was following. The organization of this book is quite good, and the content quite complete.  Everything I'd expect from a quality A-W piece of work.</blockquote>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Craig Gardner</p><hr/>


<p><blockquote class="q">I think this is a timely book - right now
source control is most definitely a black art, and most teams do it
badly if at all. There are very few books on the subject.</blockquote>
&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Dave Thomas, co-author of <em class="title">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X/steveberczuk">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</em></a></p><hr/>

<p><blockquote class="q">There's a lot of expertise captured here and
I get a sense of really sitting down with someone who understands
these issues.</blockquote>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Linda Rising, author of <em class="title">
<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201615673/steveberczuk">
The Pattern Almanac 2000</a></em></p><hr/>

<p><blockquote class="q">I think this is an excellent book. If you're at
all serious about software development, you need SCM; this book could
make that case and not only convince readers that they need it, but
provide enough information that they could immediately apply the
patterns on their projects.</blockquote>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;James Noble, co-author of <em class="title">Small Memory Software: Patterns for Systems with Limited Memory</em></p><hr/>


<p><blockquote class="q">This book is  a good overview of a very important area in current software development projects. I say this as someone who has endured (along with my fellow team members) various struggles with SCM systems in the last several companies where I have worked. There is very little readily available literature in this field and I believe this book, will prove to be very important to anyone working in a medium to large sized development team.</blockquote>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bernard Farrell, WaveSmith Networks</p><hr/>
