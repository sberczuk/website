<tr><th>Pattern Name</th><th>Summary</th></tr>
<tr><td><hr/></td><td><hr/></td></tr>
<tr><th>Mainline</th><td>Minimize merging, and keep the number of active codelines to a manageable set by developing on a Mainline.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Active Development Line</th><td>Keep a rapidly evolving codeline stable enough to be useful by creating an Active Development Line</td></tr>
<tr><th>Private Workspace</th><td>Prevent integration issues from distracting you, and from your changes causing others problems by developing in a Private Workspace.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Repository</th><td>Set up a new workspace by populating it from a Repository that contains everything that you need.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Private System Build</th><td>Check to see that your changes will not break the build by doing a Private System Build before commiting changes to the Repository.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Integration Build</th><td>Ensure that your code base always builds reliably by doing an Integration Build periodically.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Third Party Codeline</th><td>Manage vendor code by using a Third Party Codeline.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Task Level Commit</th><td>Organize source code changes by task-oriented units of work.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Codeline Policy</th><td>Create a Codeline Policy to help developers decide when to check in code to a codeline and what procedures to follow before a checkin on each codeline.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Smoke Test</th><td>Ensure that the system still works after you make a change by running a Smoke Test.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Unit Test</th><td>Verify that a module still works after you make a change by running a Unit Test.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Regression Test</th><td>Ensure that existing code doesn't get worse as you make other improvements by running a Regression Test.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Private Versioning</th><td>Use Private Versioning to allow you to experiment with complex changes locally, yet still be able to take advantage of the features of a version control system.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Release Line</th><td>Maintain released versions without interfering with your current development by establishing a Release Line.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Release-Prep Codeline</th><td>Stabilize a codeline for an upcomming release while also allowing new work to continue on active codelines by doing the stabilization work on a Release-Prep codeline.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Task Branch</th><td>Have part of your team perform a disruptive task without forcing the rest of the team to work around them, using a Task Branch.</td></tr>
