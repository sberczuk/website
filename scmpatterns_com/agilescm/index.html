<h1><!--#echo var="pagetitle"--></h1>
<p>This page describes how we see the values of the 
<a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> relate to
software configuration management (SCM).
</p>

<dl>
<dt><em>Individuals and Interactions over Processes and
Tools</em>.</dt> <dd> SCM processes and tools should support the way
that you work, not the other way around. Often, the reason behind
frustrating SCM processes is trying to impose an overly-rigid process on
a team, or attempting to use a tool that imposes a process into an
organization that is different than the process the organization
needs.</dd>

 
<dt><em>Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation</em>.</dt>
<dd>SCM can automate development policies and processes with executable
knowledge rather than have the team rely on documented knowledge. You can make
things easy for developers and ensure that necessary procedures are
followed by writing scripts instead of documenting
procedures.</dd>

<dt><em>Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation</em>.</dt>
<dd>SCM can facilitate communication and interaction among
stakeholders and help manage expectations. The appropriate tools and processes
can provide customers with visibility into the status of a project and
allow them to contribute to the project where appropriate.</dd>

 
<dt><em>Responding to Change over Following a Plan</em>.</dt>
<dd>SCM is about facilitating change, not preventing it. Use SCM policies
and structures that allow your development team to progress at an
appropriately rapid pace. Don't make the entire team
move at the pace of the slowest changing component.</dd>
