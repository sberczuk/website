Since there will always be legacy code, this is a very practical book. The author emphasises the role of testing as a change enabler in a way that echos the the ideas in the SCM Patterns book.<br>

Most teams do not do this and start their application by solving technology problems. This book describes the utility of a domain-driven approach to building systems and shows you how to apply this approach effectively. This book makes excellent use of patterns to demonstrate how design, architecture and development practices such as continuous integration interact with each other to determine how good your application will be. Like all good patterns books, the information in this book seems obvious once you read it. But it is material most people overlook. Buy this books to understand the value of a domain driven approach, or if you already understand that, use it as a guide for teaching others.<br>

An understanding of how software organizations work is essential to building good software systems. Coplien and Harrison are two of the pioneers in writing patterns about software organizations, and this book is a useful guide to helping you understand how to build effective software development organizations.<br>

This book discusses the relationship between technical-architecture and marketing-architecture. This is an oft-neglected subject, but it is important as marketing and technology are both important for a successful product. This is a great book to read if you design software systems, or are involved in product management.<br>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020172183x/steveberczuk"><img src="cover/020172183X.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" border="0" alt="Writers' Workshops &amp; the Work of Making Things: Patterns, Poetry..." hspace="4" vspace="3" align="left"></a>This is a unique book. It tells you about the writers workshop process. The writers workshop process has its origins in the creative writing community, and has been used in the software patterns community. Richard Gabriel explains how the process can also be used in other domains where creative effort is involved, such as reviewing marketing materials. I book for two reasons. First it provide great insight into the creative process (as applied to anything) and the values that are used in the writers workshop can benefit anyone who creates things, even if they don't use the workshop process. Second, if you do want to use writers workshops, this book explains the hows and whys of them. I had been involved in workshopping software patterns since 1995, and I though that I pretty much understood what they were about. I learned a lot reading this book. I recommend this book for anyone who involved in the creative process(of any sort): Software engineers, writers, teachers, and students.<br>

While these are "patterns" in the more conventional sense (recurring structures, but not broken down into Problem/Context/Solution), this book will tell you a lot about database design.<br>

If you've been doing Object-Oriented programming for a while you probably know much of what is in here, but it is worth reading anyway, both as a reminder, and as a way to explain the techniques to others. Fowler describes the refactorings very clearly, with guidelines on when to use each technique. Like Design Patterns, this book provides a vocabulary for the important techniques you use to change code. The examples are in Java, but the techniques can be adapted to any OO language, such as C++ quite readily.<br>
