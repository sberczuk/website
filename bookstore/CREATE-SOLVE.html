<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0547391404/steveberczuk"><img src="cover/0547391404.jpg" border="0" alt="The Storytelling Animal" hspace="4" vspace="3" align="left"></a>Jonathan Gottshcall discusses why stories are so pervasive in our lives, in a well written, compelling book that explores the science, history, and future of stories and storytelling. Among other things, the book covers why children and adults create and consume fiction, the science of dreams, the role of stories in influencing (and defining) history, and what technology means for the future of stories. Not just full of interesting facts, many chapters start out in the manner of a compelling story, drawing you into learning about the science and history of story telling, proving the point stories are a great way to learn. Many of my favorite technical books interlace stories with technical details. If you are curious about how the mind works, and in the science and role of stories, or even just want some great examples of how to use story to make a point, read this book. (This review is based on a pre-publication review copy).

   Since typography is a highly visible part of user experience, it is an area  anyone who builds applications with user interfaces should be familiar with. This book is full of history, facts, and trivia, and pointers to where to find more information. Typography geeks will find many references to familiar facts and sources as well as updated information. Those who are not familiar with some of the classics of typography will learn enough to get a sense of whether they want to learn more. Everyone will discover much about fonts and typography to inform decisions about what font to use when the next open a rich-text editor.  Everyone who uses fonts, who is not otherwise schooled in typography should give this book a look. And even those who are experts may benefit from Garfield's perspective.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805091742/steveberczuk"><img src="cover/0805091742.jpg" border="0" alt="The Checklist Manifesto" hspace="4" vspace="3" align="left"></a>This is a book written by a surgeon, talking about how doctors, structural engineers, pilots and others use checklists to manage complexity and manage risk. While reading it, I kept thinking of all the things the scenarios he described has in common with software projects, and how the checklists reenforced the same values that agile software teams hold dear. Gawande illusrates how checklists help people be more creative, more productive and solve problems by allowing people to focus on the novel parts of a problem. What I especially liked was the recurring theme of how complex problems are best solved by teams and not heroic individuals, and how processes, like those guided by checklists can help foster teamwork. This is an easy to read book that helps you understand what all complex endeavors have in common, regardless of profession, and gives you one approach to managing this complexity. Read it if you want to understand how to write good checklists and use them effectively, and to address the negative perceptions colleagues have about processes and checklists.<br>

Most of the advice seems obvious, yet it if often the obvious that one needs to be reminded of.

The principles are inspired by observing how theatre companies work, but they also have a basis in lean manufacturing. If you work as a software developer or manager and have ever worked on a theatre production (community theatre or at school) a light will go on immediately. If you haven't The data that the authors provide about lean manufacturing practices and software development will convince you that there is a lot that we can learn from this metaphor. The theatre examples will be helpful in explaining how the principles work if you need to communicate them to a manager who does not understand software development. Buy this book and place it along side your books on agile software development; you will want to read it and refer back to it frequently.<br>

It tells you about the writers workshop process. The writers workshop process has its origins in the creative writing community, and has been used in the software patterns community. Richard Gabriel explains how the process can also be used in other domains where creative effort is involved, such as reviewing marketing materials. I book for two reasons. First it provide great insight into the creative process (as applied to anything) and the values that are used in the writers workshop can benefit anyone who creates things, even if they don't use the workshop process. Second, if you do want to use writers workshops, this book explains the hows and whys of them. I had been involved in workshopping software patterns since 1995, and I though that I pretty much understood what they were about. I learned a lot reading this book. I recommend this book for anyone who involved in the creative process(of any sort): Software engineers, writers, teachers, and students.<br>

This is a quick read, with many interesting stories to support the assertions that the book makes.
