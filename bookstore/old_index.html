it does provide a great way of thinking about  the issues and how to

life-and-death scenarios, to  the more banal, but still
difficult.<br clear="left" />

<img align="left" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="cover" border="0" src="cover/020172183X.01.TZZZZZZZ.jpg" />
</a>This is a unique book. It tells you about the writers  workshop process. The writers workshop process has its  origins in the creative writing community, and has been used  in the software patterns community. Richard Gabriel explains  how the process can also be used in other domains where  creative effort is involved, such as reviewing marketing  materials. I book for two reasons. First it provide great  insight into the creative process (as applied to anything)  and the values that are used in the writers workshop can  benefit anyone who creates things, even if they don't use the  workshop process. Second, if you do want to use writers  workshops, this book explains the hows and whys of them. I  had been involved in workshopping software patterns since  1995, and I though that I pretty much understood what they  were about. I learned a lot reading this book.   I recommend this book for anyone who involved in the  creative process(of any sort): Software engineers, writers,  teachers, and students.<br clear="left" />

</a>This is a unique book. It tells you about the writers  workshop process. The writers workshop process has its  origins in the creative writing community, and has been used  in the software patterns community. Richard Gabriel explains  how the process can also be used in other domains where  creative effort is involved, such as reviewing marketing  materials. I book for two reasons. First it provide great  insight into the creative process (as applied to anything)  and the values that are used in the writers workshop can  benefit anyone who creates things, even if they don't use the  workshop process. Second, if you do want to use writers  workshops, this book explains the hows and whys of them. I  had been involved in workshopping software patterns since  1995, and I though that I pretty much understood what they  were about. I learned a lot reading this book.   I recommend this book for anyone who involved in the  creative process(of any sort): Software engineers, writers,  teachers, and students.<br clear="left" />

Fowler describes the  refactorings very clearly, with guidelines on when to use  each technique. Like Design Patterns, this book provides a  vocabulary for the important techniques you use to change  code. The examples are in Java, but the techniques can be  adapted to any OO language, such as C++ quite readily.<br clear="left" />

While these are  "patterns" in the more conventional sense (recurring  structures, but not broken down into  Problem/Context/Solution), this book will tell you a lot  about database design.<br clear="left" />

</a>This book describes what to do to change code that has   gotten messy with time, and how to proceeed to make the  changes. If you've been doing Object-Oriented programming for  a while you probably know much of what is in here, but it is  worth reading anyway, both as a reminder, and as a way to  explain the techniques to others. Fowler describes the  refactorings very clearly, with guidelines on when to use  each technique. Like Design Patterns, this book provides a  vocabulary for the important techniques you use to change  code. The examples are in Java, but the techniques can be  adapted to any OO language, such as C++ quite readily.<br clear="left" />
