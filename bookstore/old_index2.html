Craftsmanship: The New Imperative" hspace="3" vspace="3"/></A>
This book discusses the differences between a craft approach and an
engineering approach to building software, and the benefits of using a
craft approach to build most software applications. It is a great book
to read to learn how to think about your career, or how to build a
software organization. This book is not about Agile Development, <em>per
se</em>, but if you are interested in that, you should read this book
too because the Agile development works best when there are people
skilled in the craft of software working on the project.

A good overview of how a move to object technology can, and cannot effect project success. Using case studies, Alistair Cockburn describes the importance of people in the success of an OO project. He also emphasises that the move to object technology involves a different way of thinking, not just a new programming language.

DeMarco's book is similar in style to 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0884270610/steveberczuk">The Goal</a> 
but covers software development rather than manufacturing. The protagonist takes on a difficult management assignment and learns many of the lessons of modern project management. It is a quick, enjoyable read, and it passes on its lessons with humor, so they are easily remembered.  You will want to read some more traditional books on project management, it addition to this book, but this book motivates the lessons in more traditional books.

had really good stuff on the people issues that affect software development. Even if you are not a manager, these books provide you with information on how to work more effectively with team members and managers alike, and, understand, if not justify some annoying management practices. (I haven't yet read Volume 4: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0932633323">Anticipating Change</A>, but there is probably valuable stuff in there as well.)

This book is about how people make decisions in a variety of circumstances. This includes solo decision making in crisis situations, as well as team decisions. Discusses the value of stories in expressing and clarifying the decision making process. The discussion of stories (known uses) and the importance of clarifying intent while giving instructions make this worthwhile reading for those studying patterns as a means of conveying expertise.

This book describes what to do to change code that has gotten messy with time, and how to proceeed to make the changes. If you've been doing Object-Oriented programming for a while you probably know much of what is in here, but it is worth reading anyway, both as a reminder, and as a way to explain the techniques to others.  Fowler describes the refactorings very clearly, with guidelines on when to use each technique. Like Design Patterns, this book  provides a vocabulary for the important techniques you use to change code. 

The examples are in Java, but the techniques can be adapted to any OO language, such as C++ quite readily.

This is an excellent discussion about component software. It covers general issues involved in component design and distribution, including  technical issues and marketing issues. It provides a good comparison of the major component technologies (COM, CORBA and Java Beans), and it also contains a good deal of timeless information. While this is not always light reading, it is very well written. This is a book developers, architects, and product managers can all read parts of!

An excellent book. It describes what is in an effective web sites, and provides many examples of good and bad web design. People who work with web sites at all levels: users, project managers, and people who implement web sites, will find this book incredibly useful and inspirational. Read this book before doing any work on a web site or intranet.

An interesting book. Brand discusses the

If you didn't already understand it, this book explains when and why the long view is necessary.  I think that this is a worthwhile read for systems designers, as well as excellent general interest reading.

Interesting, and well written, historical overview of how the environment shaped the development of human society. It's a sort of history of the world in 400 pages. This book gives lots of examples of the differences between apparent causes and root causes. It you like history, or are often curious about why things are, this is a worthwhile book.

<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0802713424/steveberczuk">The Victorian Internet</A> by Tom Standage
</dt>
<dd>
This book describes parallels between the social impact of the telegraph and that of the Internet. The title put me off the book initially, since I thought that comparisions between the telegraph and the Internet would be tenuous. However, I was surprised to find out that there were issues about on-line romances, on-line fraud, among other familiar sounding issues, in the age of the telegraph. This book is yet another reminder that there are a whole host of issues that continue to arise whenever a new communications technology is introduced. A quick, interesting read.

A collection of good, time tested, ideas. The authors give examples in C++, Java, scripting languages, and C. The examples are biased towards C, but there are good general principles about design, coding, debugging and testing. Combine this book with <A HREF="#0201824671" target="_self">Multi-Paradigm Design for C++</a>, and you will have inspiration to look at problems multiple ways before jumping in and coding.

Multi-Paradigm Design for C++</a> by Jim Coplien.

Coplien explains how to apply <em>commonality and variability analysis</em> to solve problems using <em>all</em> the tools at the disposal of the C++ programmer. The book shows how and when to combine the object-oriented, functional, and generic paradigms along with  other tools such as patterns. The book is primarily of use to the experienced C++ developer/designer, but anyone with a interest in how software design is influenced by the application language will find the book interesting.
