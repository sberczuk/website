<p>This page explains why I started the books page and how I put the
books page together, for those who are curious. I started the
recommended books page because people would often ask me to suggest
books to read on technical topics. I heard about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/associates/join/associates.html">Amazon Associates</a>
program and decided that it would be a good thing to organize the page
around. The books page generates a <em>very</em> small amount of
income, and it all goes towards paying for my domain and hosting
services. So, the real purpose is to have place to suggest books that
I have found useful.</p>

<p>Another purpose that this page serves is to be a place for me to
experiment with web technologies. In many cases I try to do things in
a way that is as simple as possible (this is a hobby after all). But
if I have the time and motivation, I'll use this site as a learning
experience. Often the end result is still that the site is easier to
maintain and use.</p>

<h2>About the Books</h2>
<p>
Every book on this page is one that I have read (though sometime in
manuscript form prior to actual publication) or had highly recommended
to me, and which I used to solve a problem, or is closely related to a
book that I found useful (for example a newer edition of a favorite book).
</p>
<h2>About the Page</h2>
<p>
I originally updated this page entirely by hand coded html, and using
some of the link generation tools that amazon provides. A short while
ago I decided that it made more sense to generate the page dynamically
from XML. The elements of this process are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="books.dtd">DTD</a> that defines the structure of the
entries. (I plan to use XSD soon).</li>
<li>An <a href="books.xml">XML Source file</a> with the raw data. (You
may need to <em>save</em> this file rather than view it if your
browser supports XSLT transformations.</li>

<li>An <a href="book-std.xsl">XSLT Stylesheet</a> to generate HTML
from the XML.(You may need to <em>save</em> this file rather than view
it if your browser supports XSLT transformations.)</li>

<li>An XSLT Engine, <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">Apache Xalan</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> Server Side Includes to insert some elements (like some
amazon provided code) that is not XHTML compliant.</li>
</ul>
