<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321601912/steveberczuk"><img src="cover/0321601912.jpg" border="0" alt="Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation" hspace="4" vspace="3" align="left"></a>
     This book will help you to understand that the secret to quality software, reliably deployed, is to take a cross-functional approach. You will walk away from  this book with an understanding of how to start implementing a continuous deployment pipeline, and you may also find yourself writing down a list of things to try, and tools to use. While not a tool-centric book, the authors provide many examples of tools to help you implement each phase of the process. Since no one book can cover every aspect of every step in the development process,  the authors point you to many excellent resources if you want to learn more. While the authors have experience in, an a pre-disposition for, Agile techniques, the principles described in  this book apply to any organization, whatever the process,  though if you take the approach to heart, you will find yourself becoming more agile. This book covers every aspect of the development process from requirements,  design, and coding, to acceptance testing, deployment and operations. While having a lot of material, the book is well organized and written. It's not a quick read, and you'll want to have a notebook or post-its handy to capture the idea it helps you to generate, but if you are interested in improving your deployment process you will find this book  valuable, whether you are a developer, tester, release engineer, or someone who manages people in those roles.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321685865/steveberczuk"><img src="cover/0321685865.jpg" border="0" alt="Configuration Management Best Practices: Practical Methods that Work in the Real World" hspace="4" vspace="3" align="left"></a>When I reviewed an early draft of this book I was pleased to see a book on SCM that wasn't just about tools and processes (though it covers those things) but also about people. SCM is about enabling people to work together effectively, and tools and processes are essential, but you need to use them with an understanding of how people work. This book covers not just version control but the range of CM activities from build to deployment, even covering hardware CM issues. While anyone who works with software may benefit from this book, those who manage teams and project or are looking to improve their SCM processes will find the approach especially useful.

This book can guide you to understanding how to manage releases in an agile environment, and how to apply basic CM concepts like build and branching successfully. While not a replacement for a book on your agile method, this book is a primer on agile for those with a traditional release management background, and and a primer on CM for those who understand agile. After reading it you will have enough background to be productive, and a good sense of what you need to learn more about. In  addition, this book covers topics such as how to leverage cloud service providers for infrastructure, how to leverage SCM to make off-shore development less painful, and how to evolve your SCM process in an agile (incremental) fashion. With a good structure that allows you to navigate the book quickly, and a good use of metaphor to describe concepts, this book will help a release managers, project managers, developers and architects use the SCM process to get the most out of their agile teams. (I was a reviewer of  the manuscript, this review is based on the final edition.)<br>

In addition to describing hpw the various commands work this book helps you understand how to structure your version control system to use Perforce effectively. This book describes not only how to create branches, but why, and what policy to have on the branch. The Channelling the Flow of Change chapter is a great introduction to change management concepts in general. Buy this book if you are using Perforce as your SCM solution, or even if you are evaluating multiple solutions, and Perforce is a candidate, as this book will help you understand how to structure your environment for effective development.<br>

This book is an excellent companion to Software Configuration Management Patterns; it provides teriffic information that support the build patterns in that book.<br>

It is a great resource to read and to have on your shelf if you want to understand the scope of SCM. It is not entirely clear to me why this book is in AW's Agile series, but it is a worthwhile read so that you can understand what aspects of more formal SCM that you may be (justifiably) skipping on your project after you have implemented the techniques in the SCM Patterns book.<br>
