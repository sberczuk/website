<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312427654/steveberczuk" title="Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance" id="0312427654">Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance</a> by Atul Gawande</dt>
<dd>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312427654/steveberczuk"><img src="cover/0312427654.jpg" border="0" alt="Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance" hspace="4" vspace="3" align="left"></a>
    
    While Gawande stays clearly in the domain of medicine, there are lessons in this book to be learned by those working in any craft that combines technology, personal skill, and human interaction. Better is a good read for anyone seeking to understand performance and how important the individual and collaboration are in a profession one often thinks of as the being dominated by individual practitioners with highly specialized skills. What was especially interesting to me was how this book brought to mind parallels with what seems to be a vastly different practice: Software development. The stories of practice in rural India seemed to make a case for the value of "generalizing specialists," the discussion of infection prevention was an echo of the value (and difficulty) of getting a team to be disciplined in using a few simple practices. Almost every chapter found me making notes about parallels to software development. I suspect those in other fields that require both individual skills, judgement, and collaboration might find the same thing. This wasn't unexpected, as I had first read The Checklist Manifesto, but that book was explicit about the parallels. If you are interested in health care, want to understand how to apply skills more effectively, or simply just like a good story, Better is good, Gawande mixes anecdote, data, and an almost suspenseful presentation style to make what could be an academic discussion approachable and entertaining. For a more detailed review see <a href="http://steveberczuk.blogspot.com/2011/05/better-more-parallels-between-medicine.html"> my blog</a>

<dd>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670033375/steveberczuk"><img src="cover/0670033375.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" border="0" alt="Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed" hspace="4" vspace="3" align="left"></a>People and cultures seem to many things that don't make sense in retrospect. This book asks and attempts to answer the question of why once successful societies disappeared. Diamond combines an historical perspective with a discussion of modern day comunities so that we can see the parallels, and perhaps make better decisions in the future. While not an easy read, Diamond makes a complicated subject very approachable. This is a thought-provoking book that you should read if you are interested in society, the environment, or even just general decision making processes (if whole cultures can make decisions that cause them to fail, what can we expect from organizations!).<br>

Brand discusses the Long Now project, but puts it in the context of the different time scales we all work on. If you didn't already understand it, this book explains when and why the long view is necessary. I think that this is a worthwhile read for systems designers, as well as excellent general interest reading.<br>

It you like history, or are often curious about why things are, this is a worthwhile book.<br>

The title put me off the book initially, since I thought that comparisions between the telegraph and the Internet would be tenuous. Howev er, I was surprised to find out that there were issues about on-line romances, on-line fraud, among other familiar sounding issues, in the age of the telegraph. This book is yet another reminder that there are a whole host of issues that continue to arise whenever a new communications technology is introduced. A quick, interesting read.<br>

Given the title this is a very approachable book, and even has its amusing moments. I found it a bit easier to read than The Language Instinct , which is also worth a look if you are interested in where language comes from.<br>

An excellent book that guides us to the coming era when computers are in tools we use everyday, rather than complicated devices we need to be experts to use.<br>

Hillis intrpoduces concepts such as boolean algebra, algorithms, finite state machines, turing machines, and even emergent behavior. I recommend this book if you already understand the ideas, but what to explain them to someone, or for the somewhat mathematically inclined person who wants to understand how computers work. You don't need to be a math maven to understand this book, but an inclination towards logical thinging helps.<br>
