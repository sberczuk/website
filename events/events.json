        "description": "I gave a class on how to use Specialists to fill gaps and also help agile teams become more self-sufficient. As teams grow, organizations often draw a distinction between feature teams, which deliver the visible business value to the user, and component teams, which manage shared work. This distinction can help organizations be more productive and scale effectively, but he recognizes that not all shared work fits into this model. Some work is best handled by “specialists,” that is people with unique skills. Although teams composed entirely of T-shaped people is ideal, certain skills are hard to come by and are used irregularly across an organization. Since these specialists often need to work closely with teams, rather than working from their own backlog, they don’t fit into the component team model. The use of shared resources presents challenges to the agile planning model. I share how teams such as those providing infrastructure services and specialists can fit into a feature+component team model, and how variations such as embedding specialists in a scrum team can both present process challenges and add significant value to both the team and the larger organization.",

Some teams adopting agile start by making changes and tweaks to prescribed processes, which can cause problems. This class explains how following the recommended practices of your chosen agile method for a time will help you internalize the process and leverage the experiences of those who developed the method. Premature customization can lead to more problems and eventually to failure.",

Many teams are puzzled by how to translate standard SCM “Best Practices” to an agile environment. In a effort to move more quickly some teams ignore basic software configuration management practices with the result they  hit stumbling blocks down the line. Others maintain many of their old practices with the result that their teams are  less agile. This tutorial will start with an overview of key SCM concepts, including codeline management,, build and release, and branching. We will them discuss how basic SCM principles apply to an agile team, and how  you apply SCM Practices can help make your team more or less agile, and how they can ease the transition to agile when you have a legacy code base to work with. We’ll discuss questions such as when branching makes sense, when how using Scrum or XP affects how you think about version management, and the importance of simple but effective SCM practices to agile software development. Attendees should be familiar with some basic version management tools like CVS or subversion. This tutorial will focus on practices, not tools, but will reference tools such as ant, maven , subversion in examples.  Developers, team leads, project managers and release engineers will find this class useful.",

You have to live with code that is not as testable, or as modular as you’d like, and you have to manage support concerns that disrupt your iteration plan, Even if your project is agile, you may have dependencies on legacy projects that are not be delivering at iteration boundaries. I explain how to be agile with a legacy code base using design, testing, build, and software configuration management practices so that you can be agile when your code is not while managing the flow of change required to support released code. At the end of the class you will better understand how to balance the requirements of working with an existing code base with the desire to have a more agile development environment.",

It's hard to understand what practices you can compromise and which ones are important. Do you really have to test first? Or is soon OK? Can you adjust sprint boundaries mid-iteration? Some compromises to the agile dogma can be made while still staying in the spirit of your method. Some compromises make it harder to benefit from agile practices. In this session, you will learn how to make pragmatic decisions about how to practice -- and benefit from -- agile software development.",
