<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
Agile Methods are advocated as a way of producing better
software. Advocates of agile methods suggest that practices such as
keeping in close communication with your customers, frequent
integration, and frequent assessment of project status will enable us
to produce software that has value for the customer - quality
software. It's hard to argue with that.  But why is this any different
than simply "good" software development practice? Why does saying
"Scrum" "Agile" or "XP" grab peoples' attention? Why does it take a
name for useful practices to be accepted?</p>

<p>This panel will help us understand the role of hype in getting
useful practices accepted or rejected. We will explore why it is that
these good ideas have not been more widely used. Some of the questions
that the panel and the audience will explore are: Why do we ignore
proven practices until we see them packaged as a "method?" Can we do
something different in the workplace or in school to teach these
practices? Or is it the case that these practices are not universally
good?</p>
<p>
This panel talks about agility in a different context than what is
typical: we won't just discuss what agile practices are. We will
explore why they are not more widely adopted, especially when not
packaged as part of a "named" method like XP.  And we will discuss why
projects suffer even when the methods that can help them are well
known.</p>
 
<p>This panel will provide an entertaining and thought provoking forum
for discussing an issue that is ever present in the world of
technology: the role of hype. We concentrate on agile practices,
moving beyond simply enumerating them, to discussing why they are not
more widely adopted.</p>

<h2>Panel Description and Position Statements</h2> 
<h3>Steve Berczuk, steve@berczuk.com</h3>
<p>Steve has been developing object-oriented software applications
since 1989, often as part of geographically distributed teams where
flexibility and agility were essential. He has been an active member
of the Software Patterns community since 1994 and has published a
number of articles on the relationship between organization, software
architecture, and design patterns. He has an M.S. in Operations
Research from Stanford University and an S.B. in Electrical
Engineering from MIT. Steve is the author of the book Software
Configuration Management Patterns: Effective Teamwork, Practical
Integration, published by Addison Wesley (www.scmpatterns.com), which
is about software configuration management in an agile
environment.</p>
</p>
<p>Steve wonders why some projects fail because they don't use
practices known to be effective, and why others fail because they use
"hyped" processes inappropriately. This panel presents an opportunity
to have an interesting and productive discussion on the role of hype
in acceptance and rejection of effective techniques. Between the
contributions of the panelists and those of the audience this panel
should be informative and entertaining.</p>

<h3>Neil Harrison, nbharrison@avaya.com</h3>

<p>Neil Harrison is a researcher at Avaya Labs, where he consults with
software projects in software architecture, process, organizations,
estimation, and product line engineering. He has studied the
application of agile development methods in large organizations, and
has practiced agile software development. He has been involved in
software patterns since 1994.  He has organized pattern conferences
and has taught many courses on patterns, especially in the area of
pattern shepherding.  He is currently a member of the board of
directors of the Hillside group.  He has published patterns and
articles in several pattern books, and was the lead editor of Pattern
Languages of Program Design, Volume 4.</p><p>Neil sees many attitudes
towards agile methods, and two of particular interest: One camp has
been doing agile practices for years, and wonders what all the fuss is
about. The other camp sees that not all practices are appropriate in
all situations, and correctly asks, "What's so right about doing
things eXtreme?" These are two of several reasons that agile practices
aren't adopted: first, that they are already being done, and second,
that they sometimes shouldn't be done.</p>

<h3>Kevlin Henney, kevlin@curbralan.com</h3>

<p>Kevlin Henney is an independent consultant and trainer. The focus
of his work is in programming languages, OO, CBD, UML, patterns, and
software architecture. He is a regular columnist for Application
Development Advisor (UK), JavaSpektrum (Germany), and C/C++ Users
Journal online, and a former columnist with Java Report and C++
Report. He is also program chair for the EuroPLoP 2003 conference, a
member of Hillside Europe and the OT conference program committee, as
well a regular speaker at conferences in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>Kevlin's position on this issue is that if practice makes perfect,
the absence of practice is one of the main problems that many
companies, projects and individuals seem to be suffering
from. Sometimes it feels like companies would rather adopt practices
in name only, leaving adoption in deed as an irrelevant implementation
detail.</p>

<h3>Joshua Kerievsky, joshua@industriallogic.com</h3>

<p>Joshua Kerievsky has been programming professionally since 1987,
and is the founder of Industrial Logic (http://industriallogic.com), a
company specializing in Extreme Programming (XP). Since 1999, Joshua
has been coaching and programming on small, large and distributed XP
projects and teaching XP to people throughout the world. He is the
author of numerous XP and patterns-based articles, simulations and
games, including the forthcoming book, Refactoring to Patterns
(http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring)</p>
<p>Joshua's perspective on this issue is that long before the agile
hype, small numbers of talented teams and organizations successfully
practiced agile processes.  Yet we never heard about their successes.
Large-scale, agile development adoption only occurred after the world
inherited simple, concise explanations of the magic.  We remain
indebted to such authors to this day.</p>

<h3>Linda Rising, risingl@acm.org</h3>

<p> Linda Rising has a Ph.D. from Arizona State University in the area
of object-based design metrics. Her background includes university
teaching experience as well as work in industry in the areas of
telecommunications, avionics, and strategic weapons systems. She has
been working with object technologies since 1983. Linda is an
independent consultant who helps organizations get started with agile
methods, especially Scrum</p>
<p>She is the author, with Mary Lynn Manns, of the book Fear Less and
Other Patterns for Introducing New Ideas into Organizations, and is
the editor of A Patterns Handbook, A Pattern Almanac 2000, and Design
Patterns in Communications Software.  She has a number of publications
including: The Scrum Software Development Process for Small Teams,
IEEE Software, July-August 2001, Agile Meetings, STQQE, July/August
2002, and The Role of Product Champion STQE, March 2003. These and
other articles are available on her web site: lindarising.org. She is
a regular contributor to the DDC-I On-line Newsletter:
ddci.com/news_latest_news_archive.shtml.</p>
<p>Linda sees some instant successes and some slow adopters. Some
teams want to say they're agile--they get caught up in the hype -but
just keep on doing development as usual. She keeps learning about what
works well and what should be done differently with each
experience.</p> <h3>Ken Schwaber, ken.schwaber@verizon.net</h3>
<p>Ken is one of the developers of the Scrum agile process and is an
author to the Agile Manifesto. He is currently Chair of the Agile
Alliance, has presented at numerous conferences and user groups, and
is author of Agile Software Development with Scrum with Mike
Beedle. Ken has developed, managed and consulted about software
development for over 30 years. </p>
<p>He is concerned as Scrum and Agile move from the early adopters to
the mainstream that it retain its vigor, integrity, and
utility. Similarly to CMM, he has more frequently been hearing of
Agile users that are agile in name only.</p> <h3>Bobby Woolf,
woolf@acm.org</h3>
<p>Bobby Woolf has been developing multi-tier object-oriented business
applications for thirteen years using Java/J2EE, Smalltalk, and
embedded systems for messaging, workflow, business rules, and
persistence. He is a co-author of the new book Enterprise Integration
Patterns (www.eaipatterns.com) from Addison-Wesley. He became focused
on writing and using patterns after watching projects fail for lack of
simple, well-known solutions. Now he's seeing projects fail for lack
of simple, well-known practices.</p>
<p>Kent Beck said it best, quoting Ron Jefferies, "XP is what
programmers do in their own natural environment." As my friend Randy
Stafford is fond of saying, "Why should we debate what the machine
will do best? Why don't we ask the machine what it does best?" As
developers, we know when we're making progress. And customers can see
when we're making progress. When we don't know how well the machine
will make progress, try something and see how it goes. The problem
with XP is that it relies on doing what works, regardless of the
consequences, and that is not in fact the goal of a lot of
organizations. The question to ask is: Which is more important, doing
things your way, or producing good software?</p>
