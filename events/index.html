                <p>I gave a class on how to use Specialists to fill gaps and also help agile teams become more
                    self-sufficient. As teams grow, organizations often draw a distinction between feature teams, which
                    deliver the visible business value to the user, and component teams, which manage shared work. This
                    distinction can help organizations be more productive and scale effectively, but he recognizes that
                    not all shared work fits into this model. Some work is best handled by “specialists,” that is people
                    with unique skills. Although teams composed entirely of T-shaped people is ideal, certain skills are
                    hard to come by and are used irregularly across an organization. Since these specialists often need
                    to work closely with teams, rather than working from their own backlog, they don’t fit into the
                    component team model. The use of shared resources presents challenges to the agile planning model. I
                    share how teams such as those providing infrastructure services and specialists can fit into a
                    feature&#43;component team model, and how variations such as embedding specialists in a scrum team
                    can both present process challenges and add significant value to both the team and the larger
                    organization.</p>

                <p>Although agile principles sound simple, adopting agile is often extremely difficult. Some teams
                    adopting agile start by making changes and tweaks to prescribed processes, which can cause problems.
                    This class explains how following the recommended practices of your chosen agile method for a time
                    will help you internalize the process and leverage the experiences of those who developed the
                    method. Premature customization can lead to more problems and eventually to failure.</p>

                <p>Agile software development relies on feedback, and the best feedback on the state of the project
                    comes from seeing working software. Good version management, build and quality assurance are the
                    technical practices that allow you to understand how far developed your system is and what needs to
                    be done. We&#39;ll talk about the role of build, scm an QA in laying the foundation for a successful
                    agile team, and discuss the role of DevOps in helping a team keep the agile contract of ready to
                    ship code.</p>

                <p>Many conversations about Agile Software Development focus on development and project management.
                    Since feedback is essential to transition to agile software development and to maintain the values
                    of an agile team, build, configuration management, and QA practices are essential factors in
                    determining how agile a team will be. In this tall you&#39;ll learn how QA, and release management
                    practices can help an team be more agile, and how these roles can change once a team is embracing
                    agile software development.</p>

                <p>I gave a tutorial November 10-14 2008 in Orlando, FL. Version management, build, and release
                    practices are a key part of an effective agile software development environment. Many teams are
                    puzzled by how to translate standard SCM “Best Practices” to an agile environment. In a effort to
                    move more quickly some teams ignore basic software configuration management practices with the
                    result they hit stumbling blocks down the line. Others maintain many of their old practices with the
                    result that their teams are less agile. This tutorial will start with an overview of key SCM
                    concepts, including codeline management,, build and release, and branching. We will them discuss how
                    basic SCM principles apply to an agile team, and how you apply SCM Practices can help make your team
                    more or less agile, and how they can ease the transition to agile when you have a legacy code base
                    to work with. We’ll discuss questions such as when branching makes sense, when how using Scrum or XP
                    affects how you think about version management, and the importance of simple but effective SCM
                    practices to agile software development. Attendees should be familiar with some basic version
                    management tools like CVS or subversion. This tutorial will focus on practices, not tools, but will
                    reference tools such as ant, maven , subversion in examples. Developers, team leads, project
                    managers and release engineers will find this class useful.</p>

                <p>I gave a class, at the 2008 Agile Development Practices Conference November 10-14, 2008 in Orlando,
                    FL. Applying agile methods to legacy code is challenging. You have to live with code that is not as
                    testable, or as modular as you’d like, and you have to manage support concerns that disrupt your
                    iteration plan, Even if your project is agile, you may have dependencies on legacy projects that are
                    not be delivering at iteration boundaries. I explain how to be agile with a legacy code base using
                    design, testing, build, and software configuration management practices so that you can be agile
                    when your code is not while managing the flow of change required to support released code. At the
                    end of the class you will better understand how to balance the requirements of working with an
                    existing code base with the desire to have a more agile development environment.</p>

                <p>I lead a roundtable at the 2008 October 30, 2008 in Boston, MA. Agile Methods discuss practices teams
                    should follow, however, not all teams can, or should, follow every practice to the letter. It&#39;s
                    hard to understand what practices you can compromise and which ones are important. Do you really
                    have to test first? Or is soon OK? Can you adjust sprint boundaries mid-iteration? Some compromises
                    to the agile dogma can be made while still staying in the spirit of your method. Some compromises
                    make it harder to benefit from agile practices. In this session, you will learn how to make
                    pragmatic decisions about how to practice -- and benefit from -- agile software development.</p>

                <p>I taught a class. All teams can benefit from more rapid feedback, agile teams more so. Many teams
                    struggle because their software configuration management and build practices don’t help them or
                    worse, get in their way. Teams often struggle the questions of when to branch, how to create
                    developer workspaces, and the role of testing is in an SCM process. In this presentation
                    participants will learn how to create an effective development environment that allow for rapid
                    change by using the right build, version management and testing practices. Participants are invited
                    to come with questions relevant to their own situations</p>
