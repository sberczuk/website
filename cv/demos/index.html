<p>This page contains links to some projects that demonstrate how I
use various technologies for my personal projects. Some of these
projects reflect tools that I use on a regular basis, others are just
demonstrations that I did to get familiar with various internet
technologies. I collected  the links on this page to provide a more
accurate answer for the time that I am asked &quot;are you familiar
with...?&quot;</p>

<p>
These links are examples of things that I have done quickly; There are
aspects of the technologies presented here that I did not have a need
for, and I find that simpler is generally better. One constraint that
I had was the functions that my ISP supports. For example, I cannot
run J2EE applications from my web site, so some of these applications
are a mix of PHP and CGI/shell execution when a JSP solution might
have been slightly better. The good news is that for the purposes of
my web site, these implementations are good enough. 
</p>
<p>Almost as important as <em>what</em> I worked on, is <em>how</em> I
worked. In most cases my personal projects we done in an iterative
fashion with a simple solution followed by enhancements as time
allowed and my understanding of what I needed grew. I try to write all
my code using a test first approach.</p>

find on my <a href="/cv/Resume-web.html">resume</a>. This list focuses
on the Technology, not the techniques, which are also important. This
is also limited to my more recent experiences.</p>
