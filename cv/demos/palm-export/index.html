<p>This is a utilty that makes it easier to import address information from
your Palm OS device into your Mozilla email client. Mozilla will allow
you to inport VCards, but you must acknowledge each entry. You can
batch import csv data, but when you export addresses from the palm
desktop as CVS email addresses can appear in any one of the phone
fields. This application starts with a file containing VCards of all
of your contacts and generates csv file containing last name, first
name, display name, and up to 2 email addresses for each contact. To
use this do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>From your Palm Desktop Address book select all of the contacts
whose email addresses that you want to import into Mozilla. Export
these contacts as VCards.</li>
<li>Use the form below to select the file that you just exported.</li>
<li>Press <em>Process File</em> and save the file.</li>
<li>In your email client address book, import the csv file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: This is an import operation, not a synch operation, so unless
you want duplicates, you may have to delete the existing entries from
your mail client's address book. I import my entire palm address book
into a new folder in Mozilla, and delete it before I import the new one.</p>
